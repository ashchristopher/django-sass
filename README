Sass integration app for Django
================================

Django-sass integrates the power, usefulness and best of
all DRY-ness of Sass, into your Django projects.


Getting Started
-------------------------------

In your settings.py, define the path to your sass executable.

SASS_BIN = '/usr/bin/sass' # location of the sass binary

As well, you will need a dictionary to define the sass input and output files.

SASS = (
    { 
        'name' : 'test', 
        'details' : { 
            'input' : 'sass/test.sass', 
            'output' : 'css/test.css',
        }
    },
    { 
        'name' : 'test2', 
        'details' : { 
            'input' : 'sass/test2.sass', 
            'output' : 'css/test2.css', 
        }
    },
)

Once all of your Sass files have been defined in your settings.py file, you can now reference 
them in your templates.

{% load sass_tag %}
...
{% sass <name of sass in settings> %}

eg.

{% sass 'test' %}

If the named sass entry is not up to date, django-sass will automatically run the sass command on
the sass file, generating your css.


Management Command
-------------------------------
The 'sassify' command is used to generate the css manually. The css will only be generated if 
there are changes made to the sass files.

python manage.py sassify [OPTIONS]
    -- This command runs sass on all files that are not yet up to date.


Options:

'--force'
    - Forces sass to regenerate all css files from css files.

'--list'
    - List the status of your named sass entries.
    
'--clean'
    - Remove all generated files.
    
    
    
Compatability
-------------------------------
This library is only compatible with Linux/BSD based distros. I don't use Windows, so if you want 
Windows support, feel free to submit a patch.
